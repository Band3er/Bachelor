## Adding AWS IoT Certificates (for MQTT)

If this project uses secure MQTT communication (e.g., with AWS IoT Core), you need to add the following certificates to your project.

### Go to `components/mqtt_ssl/` directory

Inside there you will find:
- `client.crt` ‚Äì Device certificate  
- `client.key` ‚Äì Private key  
- `aws_root.crt` ‚Äì Amazon Root CA certificate

### üåê Step 4: Add your AWS MQTT endpoint

Inside `mqtt.c`:

```c
.broker.address.uri = ""
```

and then, from `https_protocol`:

```c
#define WEB_SERVER ""
#define WEB_PORT ""
#define WEB_URL_POST ""
```

---

## Building the Project

After setting up ESP-IDF and configuring your certificates and endpoint:

```bash
idf.py build
idf.py -p port flash monitor
```

Make sure your Ethernet connection is established  
MQTT connects successfully to AWS IoT
